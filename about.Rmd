* My name is **Ian Joo** (주이안 in Korean, 朱易安 in Chinese). My last name, Joo, is pronounced [tɕʰù]. My first name, Ian, is pronounced [i.an], and has the meaning of ease (<em>i</em>) and comfort (<em>an</em>).

* I was born in [Daejeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daejeon), South Korea.

* I did my bachelor's in Literary Studies (focusing on Francophone literature) at [Université Laval](https://www.ulaval.ca/en) (Québec City, Canada), and did my Master's in linguistics at National Chiao Tung University (Hsinchu, Taiwan), which is now [National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University](https://www.nycu.edu.tw/en/). My master's thesis is now [published at the journal Linguistic Typology](https://doi.org/10.1515/lingty-2019-0030).

* I am doing my PhD at the [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/) under the supervision of Dr. [Yu-Yin Hsu](https://sites.google.com/site/youyinxu/) and the co-supervision of Prof. [David Chor Shing Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dzmp5e4AAAAJ). I expect to attain my Ph. D. degree in early 2024.

* From September 2023, I am a lecturer at [Nagoya University of Commerce & Business](https://www.nucba.ac.jp/en/).

* My field of expertise is **linguistic typology**. My research interests are mainly **linguistic iconicity** and **areal linguistics**. In other words, I am interested in (i) the resemblance between form and meaning and (ii) how languages that are spoken close by develop similarities or dissimilarities.

* For my doctoral thesis, I have compiled [Phonotacticon 1.0](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3269302/v1), a phonological database of 516 spoken languages of Eurasia, in order to detect phonological convergence patterns across Eurasia.

* While not doing research, I enjoy hiking, painting, traveling, playing badminton, reading novels, and watching Disney films.
