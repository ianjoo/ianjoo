My first name, Ian,\nis pronounced [i.an], and has the meaning of ease (i) and\ncomfort (an).\nI was born in Daejeon, South Korea.\nMy native language is Korean.\nI did my bachelor’s in Literary Studies (focusing on Francophone\nliterature) at Université Laval\n(Québec City, Canada), and did my Master’s in linguistics at National\nChiao Tung University (Hsinchu, Taiwan), which is now National Yang Ming Chiao Tung\nUniversity. My master’s thesis is now published at the journal\nLinguistic Typology.\nI stayed at the Max Planck\nInstitute for the Science of Human History for a year as a doctoral\nstudent, but did not continue my doctoral studies there for personal\nreasons.\nI’m currently based in Hong Kong, doing my PhD\nat the Hong Kong Polytechnic\nUniversity under the supervision of Dr. Yu-Yin Hsu and the\nco-supervision of Prof. David Chor\nShing Li.\nMy research interests are mainly linguistic\niconicity and areal linguistics. In other\nwords, I am interested in (i) the resemblance between form and meaning\nand (ii) how languages that are spoken close by develop similarities or\ndissimilarities.\nFor my doctoral thesis, I am working on compiling\nPhonotacticon 1.0, a phonological database of more than\n600 Eurasian languages, in order to detect phonological convergence\npatterns across Eurasia.\nWhile not doing research, I enjoy hiking, painting, traveling,\nplaying badminton, reading novels, and watching Disney films.\nFor details, download my CV.\n\n\n\n",
