      "contents": "\nMy name is Ian Joo (주이안 in Korean, 朱易安 in Chinese). My last name, Joo, is pronounced [tɕʰù]. My first name, Ian, is pronounced [i.an], and has the meaning of ease (i) and comfort (an).\nI was born in Daejeon, South Korea.\nI am an associate professor at the Otaru University of Commerce.\nMy field of expertise is linguistic typology. My research interests are mainly linguistic iconicity and areal linguistics. In other words, I am interested in (i) the resemblance between form and meaning and (ii) how languages that are spoken close by develop similarities or dissimilarities.\nI obtained my doctoral degree at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University under the supervision of Dr. Yu-Yin Hsu and the co-supervision of Prof. David Chor Shing Li.\nCurrently, I am focusing on building and analyzing Phonotacticon, a cross-linguistic database of phonotactic information.\nWhile not doing research, I enjoy hiking, painting, traveling, playing badminton, reading novels, and watching Disney films.\n\n\n\n",
