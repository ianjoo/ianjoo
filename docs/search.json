My first name, Ian,\nis pronounced [i.an], and has the meaning of ease (i) and\ncomfort (an).\nI was born in Daejeon, South\nKorea.\nFrom September 2023, I am a lecturer at Nagoya University of Commerce &\nBusiness. From April 2024, I will be an associate professor at Otaru University of\nCommerce.\nMy field of expertise is linguistic typology. My\nresearch interests are mainly linguistic iconicity and\nareal linguistics. In other words, I am interested in\n(i) the resemblance between form and meaning and (ii) how languages that\nare spoken close by develop similarities or dissimilarities.\nI have defended my doctoral thesis Phonological areas in Eurasia at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University\nunder the supervision of Dr. Yu-Yin Hsu and the\nco-supervision of Prof. David Chor\nShing Li.\nCurrently, I am focusing on building and analyzing Phonotacticon, a\ncross-linguistic database of phonotactic information.\nWhile not doing research, I enjoy hiking, painting, traveling,\nplaying badminton, reading novels, and watching Disney films.\n\n\n\n",
