      "contents": "\nMy name is Ian Joo (주이안 in Korean, 朱易安 in\nChinese). My last name, Joo, is pronounced [tɕʰù]. My first name, Ian,\nis pronounced [i.an], and has the meaning of ease (i) and\ncomfort (an).\nI was born in Daejeon, South\nKorea.\nI did my bachelor’s in Literary Studies (focusing on Francophone\nliterature) at Université Laval\n(Québec City, Canada), and did my Master’s in linguistics at National\nChiao Tung University (Hsinchu, Taiwan), which is now National Yang Ming Chiao Tung\nUniversity. My master’s thesis is now published at the journal\nLinguistic Typology.\nI am doing my PhD at the Hong\nKong Polytechnic University under the supervision of Dr. Yu-Yin Hsu and the\nco-supervision of Prof. David Chor\nShing Li. I expect to attain my Ph. D. degree in early\n2024.\nFrom September 2023, I am a lecturer at Nagoya University of Commerce &\nBusiness.\nMy field of expertise is linguistic typology. My\nresearch interests are mainly linguistic iconicity and\nareal linguistics. In other words, I am interested in\n(i) the resemblance between form and meaning and (ii) how languages that\nare spoken close by develop similarities or dissimilarities.\nFor my doctoral thesis, I have compiled Phonotacticon\n1.0, a phonological database of 516 spoken languages of Eurasia, in\norder to detect phonological convergence patterns across\nEurasia.\nWhile not doing research, I enjoy hiking, painting, traveling,\nplaying badminton, reading novels, and watching Disney films.\n\n\n\n",
